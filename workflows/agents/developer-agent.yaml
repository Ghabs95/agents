    Issue: {issue_url}
    Urgency: {urgency}

    Your job:
    1. Read the issue and emergency triage notes
    2. Create a hotfix branch from main
    3. Implement the minimal fix required
    4. Write a test if time allows
    5. Commit with a clear message
    6. Open a PR targeting main with:
       - Title: derive from the issue title using conventional commits format
         (e.g. "fix: prevent nil pointer in webhook handler" — NOT "fix: resolve #N")
       - Body: brief description of the fix and root cause
    7. Post a summary comment on the issue with the PR link

    IMPORTANT: Speed is critical. Keep changes minimal and focused.
    Follow coding conventions: PEP 8, type hints, 100-char lines.
